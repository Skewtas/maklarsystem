Sentry integration is in place for both development and production error logging. The withErrorBoundary HOC enables easy wrapping of components, and all user-facing error messages are provided in Swedish for improved usability. Error handling utilities include a CustomError class with an AppError interface, an ErrorType enum for categorization, factory functions for common error types, a safeAsync wrapper for Promise error handling, and a Result<T,E> pattern for functional error management. API error management is handled via a handleApiResponse utility for fetch operations, HTTP status code mapping to Swedish user messages, and structured error parsing and categorization. User feedback is delivered through react-hot-toast integration, with helpers for error, success, and warning toasts, a debounced error handler to prevent spam, and a retry utility with exponential backoff. Validation helpers such as validateRequired, validateEmail, and validatePhone provide Swedish validation error messages and field-specific reporting. The error service logging structure supports Sentry and other monitoring tools, with distinct handling for development and production environments and comprehensive error detail capture.
