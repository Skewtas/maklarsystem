## Guidelines

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All requirements should be documented here, not in Task Master or other locations
2. **Version Control**: Use git to track changes to requirements
3. **Clear Structure**: Each PRD should follow the standard template
4. **Swedish Context**: Include Swedish terminology and business rules
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep documents current with decisions and changes
