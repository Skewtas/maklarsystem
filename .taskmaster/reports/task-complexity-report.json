		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Extension for Missing Fields",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema extension into: (1) Analyze and finalize missing fields and data types; (2) Write Supabase SQL migration scripts for each field group (categorical, boolean, text, numeric); (3) Update TypeScript types in database.ts; (4) Run and verify migrations in staging; (5) Document schema changes and update migration logs.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves moderate complexity due to the need for careful schema design, correct data typing, and migration safety. It requires coordination between database and TypeScript code, but follows standard migration and type update patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Update TypeScript Models and Validation Schemas",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Update TypeScript interfaces for all new fields; (2) Update or create Zod schemas for validation; (3) Integrate updated schemas into form logic; (4) Run type-checking and validation unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard synchronization task between backend and frontend types/validation. Complexity is moderate due to the need for accuracy and integration with validation libraries, but the process is well-established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Data Migration for Existing Records",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Analyze existing data and determine migration strategy for each new field; (2) Write SQL scripts or Supabase Functions for data backfill; (3) Test migration scripts in staging; (4) Validate data integrity post-migration; (5) Document migration process and results.",
			"reasoning": "Data migration is inherently risky and requires careful planning, especially with partial or missing historical data. Ensuring data integrity and rollback capability adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Dropdown Options and Field Metadata Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Define and document option lists for all categorical fields; (2) Implement static/dynamic option storage and localization; (3) Integrate options with form components and test rendering.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward implementation task with low algorithmic complexity, but requires attention to consistency, localization, and integration with UI components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Object Detail View and Listing Updates",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Update detail view components to display new fields; (2) Update listing cards to show key fields; (3) Implement conditional rendering and formatting; (4) Test UI on desktop and mobile for correctness.",
			"reasoning": "UI updates for displaying new fields are common but require careful attention to formatting, conditional logic, and responsive design. Complexity is moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "User Training and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Update and write documentation for new fields and workflows; (2) Create training materials (manuals, videos, tutorials); (3) Schedule and conduct staff training sessions.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation and training are low in technical complexity but require thoroughness and clear communication. The process is well-defined and repeatable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Form UI: Add New Fields to /nytt/page.tsx",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Design form layout and field grouping; (2) Implement new fields with correct input types; (3) Integrate with React Hook Form; (4) Add field grouping/collapsible sections; (5) Connect validation schemas; (6) Test form UI and state updates.",
			"reasoning": "Adding multiple fields to a complex form with grouping, validation, and usability considerations increases complexity, especially with modern React and form libraries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Form Validation and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement required/optional field validation; (2) Add value range and type checks; (3) Implement conditional validation logic; (4) Integrate error display with UI components; (5) Test validation and error handling for edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive validation, including conditional logic and accessibility, adds moderate complexity. Integration with form libraries and UI error handling is standard but non-trivial."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Security and Data Privacy Review",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Audit database access controls (RLS); (2) Review API authentication/authorization; (3) Assess GDPR compliance for new fields; (4) Implement input sanitization and storage best practices; (5) Set up regular backups and test restores; (6) Conduct security testing and address findings.",
			"reasoning": "Security and privacy reviews are complex, requiring cross-cutting analysis, regulatory compliance, and technical safeguards. The task spans multiple layers and demands thoroughness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility Improvements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement responsive design for all new/updated components; (2) Add accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support); (3) Test on multiple devices and browsers; (4) Run automated accessibility audits and fix issues.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring mobile responsiveness and accessibility is a standard but essential task. Complexity is moderate due to the breadth of testing and compliance with accessibility standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Search and Filtering Enhancements",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Update search UI to add filters for new fields; (2) Update backend queries to support new filters; (3) Implement debounced input for filters; (4) Optimize database indexes for performance; (5) Test search/filter functionality and performance.",
			"reasoning": "Enhancing search and filtering involves both frontend and backend changes, with performance and correctness considerations. Complexity is moderate to high, especially for large datasets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "API Endpoint Updates for Create/Update Objekt",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task with a focus on api endpoint updates for create/update objekt.",
			"reasoning": "Automatically added due to missing analysis in AI response."
